#Who was the client?

DrivePass

#What type of system did they want you to design?
#DrivePass wanted me to design a system for driving students to take classes and online practise tests.

#What did you do particlularly well?
#I did well on creating models from the business requirements.  I was able to interpept and explain the models.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
#I would revise the business requirements document.  I would add more details into the requirments needed.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design?
#I identified the technical and non-technical requirements.  I then identified what was needed for they system to follow the requirments.

#Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
#You need to understand the users needs in order to satisfy the client.  Understanding the users needs give you a starting point at designing a system.

#How do you approach designing software? 
#I approach designing software and getting information from the client and producing a visual moduel of the system.  The system needs to be explain in technical and non-technical terms.

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
#I would have a detailed interview with the client to determine what the clients requirements are.  I would present the client with a model in non-technical terms describing how the system would work.  I would use UML diagrame for the team to efficiently design and develop the system.
